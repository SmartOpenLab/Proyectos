3D design and fabrication of a "haragan": a simple four-sticks tool to remove mud and dirty.

## Motivation

To design and fabricate useful tools using surrounding waste materials is very motivating and much more to help in a disease,.

In this case we where impacted by a recent water flood, on 29-30th october 2024, at Valencia, Spain. Resulting in more than 200 people dead and
uncountable material wounds. After the flood, they do not have even access to tools to remove the dirty.

After [this beautiful new](https://www.levante-emv.com/ribera/2024/11/07/artista-fallero-carcaixent-fabrica-haraganes-dana-valencia-111407203.html), and speaking with friends there, we decided to start the construction of slots (haraganes) to remove water and mud.

## Design

We have used [Freecad0.22](www.freecad.org) for the 3D design. All the design is parametric, so using the [DynamicData workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/DynamicData_Workbench) you can change all dimensions of the design just changing this numbers.

To previously laser-mark the wooden parts to easy the build, we obtain with Freecad the 2D files, to be exported to cutting software, using the [TechDraw workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench).

## Fabrication

Because of the arrival of scientific equipments to the new [Centro Ibérico de Investigaciones en Almacenamiento Energético](www.ciiae.org) we were offered to reuse the woods from the packages. It was quite heavy and clean pine plywood, around 1500kg.

We decided to CNC route many rounded-corner long sticks using 24mm plywood, and disamsembled some hard wood pallets to make the front part of the slobs.

First, put on your PPEs! Safety glasses, gloves, face mask, and work shoes, at least.

## Used tools:

To dismantle pallets:
- Carpenter's hammer
- Metal lever
- Car lift jack
- Tongs
  
To cut the fronts and reinforcements to size:
- Miter saw

To cut the sticks:
- CNC milling machine with 9.5mm round head cutters, and 22mm diameter curved edging.

For assembly:
- Electric drill.
- 3.5x35mm and 4x40mm screws.
  
Para desmontar palets:
- Martillo de carpintero
- Palanca metálica
- Gato elevador de coche
- Tenazas
  
Para cortar los frontales y refuerzos a medida:
- Ingletadora

Para cortar los palos:
- Fresadora CNC con fresas de 9,5mm cabeza redonda, y de canteado en curva de diámetro 22mm.

Para el montaje:
- Taladro eléctrico.
- Tornillos de 3.5x35mm y 4x40mm.
